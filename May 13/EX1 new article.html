				Voters in Newark, New Jersey’s largest city, are heading to the polls on Tuesday, crossing their fingers that their next mayor can tame a host of problems, like a rising murder rate, foundering finances and troubled schools.
			</p>
			<p>
				Until a few weeks ago, the clear front-runner was Ras Baraka, a member of the Municipal Council, a high school principal and son of the poet Amiri Baraka. But support for Mr. Baraka’s little-known opponent, Shavar Jeffries, a law professor with a Horatio Alger-like life story, has surged, thanks to a deluge of television advertisements, chiefly from outside groups.
			</p>
			<p>
				The race between the two men, both Democrats, has been relentlessly negative, complete with screaming matches, arrests and accusations of vandalism. Both sides asked the United States attorney’s office to get involved, and state monitors will be present at the polls, which close at 8 p.m.
			</p>
			<p>
				Whoever wins will succeed the celebrity politician who dominated Newark politics for the last decade, Cory A. Booker, who was elected mayor in 2006 but left last year after winning election to the United States Senate. And given the shadow Mr. Booker cast, many people viewed the contest on Tuesday as a referendum on the Booker mayoralty. (Luis A. Quintana, the interim mayor until June 30, is not running for the office.)
