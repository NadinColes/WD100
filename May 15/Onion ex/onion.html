		  <span id="firstLine">LANGLEY, VA.</span> A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.
    </p>

    <p>
		  According to the report, sections of the documents "almost invariably the most crucial passages" are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.

    <p>
		  CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as: 
      
      <ul>
		    <li>the Cold War</li>
		    <li>the civil-rights movement</li>
		    <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
      </ul>
