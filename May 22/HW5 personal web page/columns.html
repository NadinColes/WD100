				<h3>
					Childhood
				</h3>
				<p>
					CM is born in a workhouse in 1830s England. His mother, whose name no one knows, is found on the street and dies just after CM's birth. He spends the first nine years of his life in a badly run home for young orphans and then is transferred to a workhouse for adults. After the other boys bully CM into asking for more gruel at the end of a meal, Mr. Bumble, the parish beadle, offers five pounds to anyone who will take the boy away from the workhouse. Oliver narrowly escapes being apprenticed to a brutish chimney sweep and is eventually apprenticed to a local undertaker, Mr. Sowerberry. When the undertaker's other apprentice, Noah Claypole, makes disparaging comments about CM's mother, CM attacks him and incurs the Sowerberrys' wrath. Desperate, CM runs away at dawn and travels toward London.

				<h3>
					Early Career
				</h3>
				<p>
					CM stowed away aboard Ylesian Dream and after a difficult flight, he arrived on Ylesia. He applied for the piloting job under the alias Vykk Draygo; he was to pilot the Ylesian Dream being a drone ship, it had been falling victim to pirate attacks. A Togorian by the name of Muuurgh was assigned to be CM's 'bodyguard', and, despite some initial tension due to the nature of the relationship, CM and Muuurgh became fast friends. CM also developed a relationship with one of the pilgrims who had come to Ylesia seeking religious sanctuary a Human woman by the name of Bria Tharen. CM remained in the High Priests' employ for a time, but after discovering the true nature of the operation- a complete scam designed to lure Pilgrims into becoming slaves he fled the planet with Tharen, Muuurgh, and Mrrov, Muuurgh's wife-to-be. Also key in his flight was that Bria, who had also learned the truth about the Ylesian fraud, was to be married to Ganar Tos. In the process, CM and Tharen stole a small cache of treasures from the High Priest Toroenza's treasure room and indirectly killed Zavval, the Hutt administrator of Ylesia. This would come back to haunt him later in his life as many bounty hunters would be after him due to the bounty placed on his head by Zavval's relatives.

				<h3>
					In the Future
				</h3>
				<p>
					In 3009, CM was needed by the Legion of Mad Fellows to help defeat the final Dark One and stop it from wiping out all life in the entire universe. Because he lacked the Delta Brainwave, his mind could not be read, and due to an accident he could temporarily read minds. With all of creation on his shoulders, he found the Dark One by chance after believing himself to be it. However, the Dark One was only a small leech, the Violet Dwarf Star became the final Encyclopod, which gave the once extinct plants and animals to the universe and easily destroyed the last Dark One.
